=== P3 LOW INCIDENTS ===

10. Configuration Drift
    - Non-production database missing encryption
    - 2 test users affected
    - No sensitive data in test environment
    - Corrected via automated compliance scan

11. Minor Security Scan Finding
    - Outdated SSL certificate on internal tool
    - 5 internal users affected
    - No external exposure
    - Certificate renewed

12. Log Retention Gap
    - Audit logs for development environment deleted prematurely

GDPR Article 34 - User Notification:
- Trigger: High risk to rights and freedoms
- Required info: Nature of breach, contact point, likely consequences, measures taken
- Method: Direct communication (email, letter)

DPDPA - India Breach Notification:

=== INCIDENT RESPONSE WORKFLOW EXAMPLE ===

Incident: Unauthorized database access by compromised employee credentials

Phase 1: DETECTION (10:00 AM)
- SIEM alert: Unusual query pattern from employee account
- Automated system flags 200+ SELECT queries in 5 minutes
- Security team notified via PagerDuty

Phase 2: CONTAINMENT (10:15 AM)
- Disable compromised employee account
- Revoke active session tokens
- Block IP address (203.0.113.45)
- Isolate affected database (read-only mode)

Phase 3: INVESTIGATION (10:30 AM - 12:00 PM)
- Review audit logs: 250 queries executed
- Affected tables: customers, orders, payment_methods
- Data accessed: 1,500 customer records
- Attack vector: Phishing email compromised credentials

Phase 4: ERADICATION (12:00 PM - 2:00 PM)
- Force password reset for all employees
- Implement 2FA requirement
- Remove malware from compromised workstation
- Patch authentication vulnerability

Phase 5: RECOVERY (2:00 PM - 3:00 PM)
- Restore database to read-write mode
- Re-enable legitimate user access
- Monitor for 24 hours for recurrence
- Update security monitoring rules

Phase 6: POST-MORTEM (Next day)
- Timeline documented: 10:00 AM detection → 3:00 PM resolution (5 hours)
- Root cause: Employee clicked phishing link, no 2FA
- Lessons learned: Need mandatory 2FA, enhanced phishing training
- Preventive measures: Roll out 2FA org-wide, quarterly security training
