# Example Governance Scenarios for L3 M4.1

## Sample Queries - Low Risk
What is our vacation policy for new employees?
How do I submit an expense report?
What are the office hours for the reception desk?
How does our health insurance coverage work?
What is the process for requesting parental leave?

## Sample Queries - High Risk (Requires Human Review)
What are the legal implications of terminating an employee for poor performance?
Can we invest company funds in cryptocurrency?
Should I fire someone for this policy violation?
Can I get legal advice on this discrimination complaint?
What is the appropriate severance package for this termination?

## Sample Bias Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Regional Disparity
Group A (North America): 0.88, 0.90, 0.87, 0.89, 0.91
Group B (Asia Pacific): 0.70, 0.72, 0.69, 0.71, 0.73
Expected: BIAS DETECTED (>20% disparity)

### Scenario 2: Department Balance
Group A (Engineering): 0.85, 0.87, 0.86, 0.88, 0.85
Group B (Marketing): 0.84, 0.86, 0.85, 0.87, 0.84
Expected: NO BIAS (<10% disparity)

### Scenario 3: Language Bias
Group A (English queries): 0.92, 0.94, 0.93, 0.91, 0.92
Group B (Non-English queries): 0.65, 0.68, 0.66, 0.67, 0.69
Expected: BIAS DETECTED - Critical (>25% disparity, blocks deployment)

## Sample Committee Review Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Model Upgrade (Approved)
Change: Upgrade from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4
Impact: +15% accuracy, no latency change
Votes: Security ✓, Legal ✓, Privacy ✓, Product ✓, Engineering ✓
Decision: APPROVED (100% approval)

### Scenario 2: New Data Source (Rejected)
Change: Add social media data to training corpus
Impact: Broader coverage but privacy concerns
Votes: Security ✗, Legal ✗, Privacy ✗, Product ✓, Engineering ✓
Decision: REJECTED (40% approval, need 75%)

### Scenario 3: Algorithm Change (Pending)
Change: Switch from semantic to hybrid search
Impact: Better precision, +50ms latency
Votes: Security ✓, Legal ✓, Privacy ?, Product ?, Engineering ?
Decision: PENDING (need 2 more votes)

## Sample Incident Reports

### Incident 1: Low Severity - Query Timeout
Type: Performance issue
Description: System timed out on complex multi-part query with 5 sub-questions
Severity: LOW
Action: Track for patterns, review at next quarterly meeting
Escalation: None

### Incident 2: Medium Severity - Hallucination
Type: Accuracy issue
Description: System generated incorrect termination policy (stated 30 days notice instead of 60)
Severity: MEDIUM
Action: Immediate correction, review generation prompt
Escalation: Committee review within 1 week

### Incident 3: High Severity - Bias Detected
Type: Fairness issue
Description: 20% quality disparity between regions detected in quarterly testing
Severity: HIGH
Action: Pause deployment to affected regions, assign remediation owner
Escalation: Immediate committee notification

### Incident 4: Critical Severity - Privacy Breach
Type: Data protection violation
Description: System exposed PII from one user to another user's query results
Severity: CRITICAL
Action: Immediate system shutdown, notify affected users, legal review
Escalation: Executive team + Board notification within 2 hours
