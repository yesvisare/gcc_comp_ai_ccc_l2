Sample Text Data for L3 M3.2: Automated Compliance Testing

=== Clean Text Examples ===

Example 1: Compliance Policy Documentation
This document outlines the compliance framework for RAG systems in financial services.
All data must be validated against PII detection policies before embedding.

Example 2: GDPR Requirements
Article 17 of GDPR grants individuals the right to request deletion of personal data.
Organizations must implement technical measures to honor such requests within 30 days.

Example 3: DPDPA Section 12 Overview
The Digital Personal Data Protection Act requires data minimization principles.
Only necessary data should be collected and processed for legitimate purposes.

=== PII Examples (Test Data - Do Not Use in Production) ===

Example 4: SSN Pattern
Customer Social Security Number: 123-45-6789
This would violate GDPR Article 17 and DPDPA Section 12.

Example 5: Email Pattern
Contact support at: compliance-team@example.com
Primary contact: john.doe@financial-services.org

Example 6: Credit Card Pattern
Payment card: 4532-1234-5678-9010
Alternative format: 4532123456789010

Example 7: Phone Pattern
Hotline: (555) 123-4567
Alternative: 555-987-6543
International: +1-555-234-5678

=== Redacted Examples (Compliant) ===

Example 8: Properly Redacted Customer Record
Customer Name: [REDACTED]
SSN: [REDACTED]
Email: [REDACTED]
Phone: [REDACTED]
Account Status: Active

Example 9: Partial Redaction (Non-Compliant)
Customer SSN: [REDACTED]
But email remains: customer@company.com
This partial redaction violates policy.

=== Regulatory Context Examples ===

Example 10: SOX Compliance
Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires 7-year retention for financial audit records.
Automated testing ensures retention policies are enforced in CI/CD.

Example 11: SOC 2 Type II
Service Organization Control 2 certification requires continuous monitoring.
Automated compliance tests provide evidence of control persistence.

Example 12: ISO 27001
Information security management standard requires documented procedures.
Policy-as-code provides auditable compliance evidence.
