========================================
3. Global IT Services RAG (GCC)
========================================

Business Context:
- Location: India GCC serving 50+ global business units
- Industry: IT services
- Data: Corporate documents, code repositories, technical documentation
- Required Frameworks: ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR (for EU clients)
- Multi-Tenant: 50+ business units across 15 countries
- Annual Revenue: ₹500 Cr

RAG Architecture:
- Components: Qdrant vector DB, Sentence Transformers, LLaMA 2, Kubernetes-based API
- Data Flows: Multi-tenant ingestion → Tenant isolation → Embedding → Storage → Retrieval
- Encryption: Per-tenant encryption keys with KMS
- Access Control: Tenant-aware RBAC, per-BU MFA policies
- Audit Logging: Per-tenant audit trails with 10-year retention
- Backup: Tenant-isolated backups with per-BU retention policies
- Vendors: AWS (DPA signed), Qdrant (self-hosted)

Compliance Status:
- ISO 27001: 88% compliant (missing A.16 incident management procedures)
- SOC 2: 85% compliant (confidentiality TSC needs key rotation)
- GDPR: 90% compliant (missing per-tenant erasure verification)

Multi-Tenant Challenges:
- 50+ distinct compliance profiles (each BU has different framework requirements)
- Chargeback model: ₹750-1,200/month per tenant
- 5-10 audits per year across frameworks
- Cross-tenant isolation verification critical

Estimated Remediation:
- Timeline: 12 weeks
- Cost: ₹18L
- Priority Gaps:
  1. Incident management procedures (28 hours)
  2. Key rotation automation (40 hours)
  3. Per-tenant erasure testing (60 hours)
  4. Multi-tenant compliance dashboard (80 hours)

========================================
4. Minimal RAG with Gaps (Startup)
========================================

Business Context:
- Location: US (San Francisco, CA)
- Industry: Tech startup
- Data: User queries, document embeddings
- Required Frameworks: None (pre-compliance phase)
- Annual Revenue: $500K

RAG Architecture:
- Components: Chroma DB (local), OpenAI embeddings, GPT-3.5
- Data Flows: Basic ingestion → Embedding → Local storage → Retrieval
- Encryption: None
- Access Control: Single admin account
- Audit Logging: None
- Backup: None
- Vendors: OpenAI (no BAA)

Compliance Status:
- GDPR: 15% compliant (critical gaps in all areas)
- SOC 2: 10% compliant (missing most controls)
- ISO 27001: 5% compliant (no ISMS)
- HIPAA: 0% compliant (not applicable, no PHI)

Estimated Remediation (if needed):
- Timeline: 24 weeks (complete rebuild)
- Cost: ₹35L
- Recommendation: Defer compliance until product-market fit

Decision: Don't build compliance yet
- Reason: Pre-revenue, < 10 customers, no regulated data
- Alternative: Manual privacy practices, implement basic encryption
- Trigger: Revisit compliance when revenue > $5M or first enterprise contract

========================================
5. Multi-Framework Overlapping Controls Example
========================================

This example demonstrates how implementing ONE control can satisfy MULTIPLE frameworks:

Control: AES-256 Encryption at Rest

Satisfies:
- GDPR Article 32: Security of Processing
- SOC 2 Confidentiality TSC: C1.1
- ISO 27001 A.10: Cryptographic Controls
- HIPAA 164.312(a)(2)(iv): Encryption and Decryption

Implementation Effort: 24 hours (one-time)
Compliance Benefit: Satisfies 4 frameworks simultaneously
Cost Savings: Avoids 3 redundant implementations (72 hours saved)

Other Overlapping Controls:
1. Audit Logging (GDPR + SOC 2 + ISO + HIPAA)
2. RBAC Access Control (GDPR + SOC 2 + ISO + HIPAA)
3. MFA (SOC 2 + ISO + HIPAA)
4. Backup Strategy (SOC 2 + ISO + HIPAA)
5. Incident Response Plan (ISO + HIPAA)

Total Controls Across 4 Frameworks: 400
Unique Controls After Deduplication: 150
Reduction: 62.5%

========================================
Summary: When to Use Multi-Framework Analyzer
========================================

✅ Use When:
- 50+ tenants across multiple jurisdictions
- 2+ frameworks required
- Regulated industries (healthcare, finance)
- Continuous compliance needed
- Budget: ₹10-20L for development

❌ Don't Use When:
- < 5 tenants
- Single framework
- Pre-revenue startup
- Budget < ₹5L

🔄 Alternatives:
- Manual audits: ₹2-4L/year
- SaaS platforms: ₹40L-1.6Cr/year (Vanta, Drata)
- In-house team: ₹1.5-2.5Cr/year

Recommended: Hybrid approach for GCC (₹16L Year 1 + ₹9L/year)
